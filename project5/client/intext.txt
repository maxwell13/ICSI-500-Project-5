source code represents the part of process that contains the programming
language itself. you may use a text editor to write your source code file. a compiler will be used
to produce a machine representation of your source code. such 
representation may show your code as hexadecimal or
binary formats. the resulting hexadecimal code will contain combinations of numbers such 1 3 5 8 or 
combinations of characters and numbers such as 1A3B4C0DEFA, for example.
